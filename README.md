# 2nd Java Project

In project 2, I created a price calculator that asked how many adult and child tickets you would like to purchase. 
It then asks which discount you would like â€“ a 10% discount, a $10 discount, or whichever pays more.  
This project helped reinforce my knowledge of loops and case statements. There is also a version of the project that 
I did with methods inside the folder.
